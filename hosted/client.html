    <p id="intro">Welcome to my implementation of Othello. This was a fun game that I used to play with my cousins that I wished to bring back on the colored screen. To Start playing, you need another player to connect</p>
    <h2 id="Instructions">How to Play</h2>
    <ol id="Instructionlist">
        <li>When its your turn, place your color piece so that it flanks the other pieces, a predict circle will help you see a possible move </li>
        <li>The game is finished when the whole board is filled with pieces</li>
        <li><i>Note: You may play this game where their are no possible moves for a player, yet spaces are still open. This is still a bug I have to fix</i></li>
